# webscraping-earthquake
Python pet project that reads live earthquakes data from the INGV (CENTRO NAZIONALE TERREMOTI) website and gives you info about particular areas you may be interested on.
In particular, the tool asks the user to input a location, a time range and the radius of the area around the chosen location the user wants to look at, prints out a message about recorded sismic activities for that area and plots the results on a plotly interactive map that pops up on your browser.
