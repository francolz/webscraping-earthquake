# webscraping-earthquake
Python pet project that reads live earthquakes data from the INGV (CENTRO NAZIONALE TERREMOTI) website and give you info about particual areas you are interested on.
In particular the tool asks the user to input a location, a time range and the radius of the area around the chosen location the user wants to look at, prints out messages about earthquakes for the area and plots those results on a plotly interactive map.
